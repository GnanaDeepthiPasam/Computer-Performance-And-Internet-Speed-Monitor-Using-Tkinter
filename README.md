# Computer Performance Monitor

## Technologies used:
Python : Programming language

Tkinter: For building graphical user interface

Psutil: For accessing hardware stats

Speedtest: For getting the internet download, upload speed and ping

## Tools used:
Visual Studio Code

## Project description:
In this project I created a desktop application that continuously tracks CPU & RAM usage in real-time. I have used the 
following technologies Python, Tkinter, psutil and speediest in order to build this project. This application will also be 
able to calculate the ping, internet download and upload speed as well. The psutil library allows us to access the OS 
level APIs and in turn give us access to the computer performance stats in real time. I first calculate the CPU usage, 
then RAM usage and finally the internet speed. Ultimately, I represent this information in a desktop app using Tkinter.
I build the entire interface for this application using Tkinter and then display all the statistics on a window.

Finally, I added distinctive fonts, colors, and visuals to enhance the look and feel of my application.
